# Overview
 This is `pysquagg`, a library containing a data structure intended for expediant computation of aggregations on a collection using Square Root Decomposition. The data structure is an extension of [Mo's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mos-algorithm-query-square-root-decomposition-set-1-introduction/).
 
# Motivation
The principles behind Mo's Algorithm is interesting and useful, but the implementation is a bit cumbersome. This library is intended to make it easier to use the algorithm in Python, plus introduce dynamic behavior, such that a collection can be modified after the data structure is created, and the corresponding blocks + aggregates are updated accordingly.
